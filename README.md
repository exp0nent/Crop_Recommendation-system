# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

## 📌 Description
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning–based web application that recommends the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions.  
It helps farmers and agricultural professionals make **data-driven decisions** to improve crop yield and profitability.

The system analyzes factors such as **soil type, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels** to suggest crops best suited for a particular region. Using historical agricultural data and predictive models, the application provides accurate and personalized crop recommendations.
